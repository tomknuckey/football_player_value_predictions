## 

Improve decision tree - hyperparameters? - DONE

Add features

Create output framework - DONE

Change so there's predictions that can be evaulated for more years - not just 2023

Add Shapley Values - DONE

Individual Shapley Value plots

Add a config

Look at hierarchial time series forecasting 

Create baseline models - moving average

Try predicting on multiple years training data.

Try different objective functions for example root means squared error

Remove inflation then add at the end 

Set seeds for random

Try Random Forest

Get shared things into function

Create new metadata thing

Feature Importance

More plots in output framework

Show examples of decision trees - run a basic decision tree model on it 

Seperate training and tuning

Take age out of it then do manual adjustments afterwards. 

Add artificial data for older players

Create table like output header / output detail that means we can plot feature importance

Adapt the 0.75 scaling for retired players by position
