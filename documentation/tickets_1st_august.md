1. Scope Features to Create

An issue is that players ability isn't considered

I want to consider how good a player is, maybe goals / assists / minutes played 

Club could be good as well, maybe club position last year.

Club_games.is_win is an important column

ppg in team strength eda is useful 

player_performance_eda is useful 

2. Do EDA
