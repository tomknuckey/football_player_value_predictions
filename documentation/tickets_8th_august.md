I think the XG boost model is now decent for predicting the next year.

The main thing to focus on now is predicting for future years

Ticket 1 - Planning this (doing research)

Ticket 2 - Creating Approach 

Ticket 3 - Testing

After this is would be good to do further analysis to understand the predictions.

Hopefully this will solve the fact that some players value doesn't decrease when they get old
