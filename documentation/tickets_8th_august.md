I think the XG boost model is now decent for predicting the next year.

The main thing to focus on now is predicting for future years

Ticket 1 - Planning this (doing research)

Ticket 1.5 - Age Data eda

Ticket 2 - Creating Approach 

Ticket 3 - Testing

After this is would be good to do further analysis to understand the predictions.

Hopefully this will solve the fact that some players value doesn't decrease when they get old


### Ideas

Take age out of it then do manual adjustments afterwards. 

Add augmented data for older players

BEFORE IN MODEL CREATE ANALYSIS TABLE FOR FEATURE IMPORTANCE

Firstly consider how this behaves 

Adding synthetic data write up
